Mental health, as defined by the World Health Organization\footnote{WHO on Mental Health - {\url{https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-health-strengthening-our-response}}}, encompasses more than just the mere absence of mental disorders. It represents a spectrum of experiences, varying in severity and impact, often leading to different social and clinical outcomes.  Unlike many common health conditions, managing mental health is inherently complex, as treatments effective for one patient may not benefit another, and everyday stressors can have a significant impact on mental health. However, there is currently no standard for assessing daily life stressors in primary care settings \cite{00006842-202204000-00003}. Therefore, there is a critical need for refined stress detection in mental health screening. 

Previous studies on stress and mental health prediction have varied in their approach to data collection and categorization, ranging from self-labeled data, which risks bias, to datasets labeled by medical professionals or third-party annotators, each with their inherent challenges in data collection and consistency \cite{coppersmith-etal-2014-quantifying, turcan-mckeown-2019-dreaddit, bertagnolli2020counsel}. Furthermore, the exploration of mental health through computational linguistics and social media analytics, as shown by \citet{sekuliÄ‡2019just} and \citet{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-09377}, highlights the complexity of detecting mental health conditions like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia through textual analysis. These studies emphasize the necessity of robust, nuanced datasets and advanced analytical techniques for effective mental health screening.

Our work responds to this gap by introducing a newly curated dataset called Stressmix, which offers a fine-grained stress categorization. This dataset improves on previous benchmark datasets by provided fine-grained stress labels. The taxonomy and dataset we present are unique in their focus on fine-grained stress types and were evaluated by an adult therapist, ensuring its relevance and precision in clinical contexts. Furthermore, this paper addresses the incomplete categorization in existing datasets, bridging the gap between their labels and our systematically constructed taxonomy.

Our main contribution is the Stressmix dataset and a detailed stress taxonomy that advances beyond basic stress detection.
