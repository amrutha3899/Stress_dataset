As individual experiences vary in severity and impact, managing mental health is inherently complex. Unfortunately, there is currently no standard for assessing daily life stressors in primary care settings. This work presents a data resource called "Stressmix" that has been tailored towards the application of enhancing mental health assessments. Stressmix includes sentences annotated with various stress types, organized using a taxonomy developed with input from a mental health expert. Addressing the limitations of existing conversational agents, we highlight the poor and ambiguous performance of LLMs, emphasizing the need for improved natural language processing tools in mental health applications. Additionally, our resource can be used to develop future tools for medical professionals that can summarize patients’ current states through a few targeted questions, offering valuable insights prior to the patient’s examination. This research represents an important step forward in achieving informed and personalized approaches to mental health care.
